# Space-Battles
Hi reader... Presenting to you is a simple game developed by myself by using vanila html, css and javascript and built on canvas.
I have taken the inspiration for this game from the Arcade games that we are familiar with.
In this game you get to control a rocket using the arrow keys and the space bar and your motive is to destroy the space enemies. 
Each time you kill certain set of enemies new batch of enemies keep generating and everytime the number of enemies keep increasing. 
The gameover logic is pretty simple. When the coordinates of the enemies exceeds the coordinates of the rocket the game ends and the score calculated is displayed along with the certain set of statements.
I hope you enjoy paying the game.
Thank you.ðŸ«¶
